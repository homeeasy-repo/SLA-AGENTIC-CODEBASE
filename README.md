# 🏠 Main Property Agent - Simplified Orchestration System

## ✅ **EXACTLY What You Wanted!**

**Single Agent Input** → **Simple JSON Output**

You give client details **ONCE** to the main agent, and it:
- Decides which tools to call internally
- Coordinates everything automatically  
- Returns clean, simple JSON

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Main Property Agent**
- **Class**: `MainPropertyAgent`
- **Function**: `process_client(client_id)`
- **Input**: Just the client ID (gets all data automatically)
- **Output**: Simple JSON with 3 fields only

### **Internal Tools** (You Never Call These Directly)
The main agent uses these as tools when needed:
1. `analyze_client_profile_tool` - Analyzes financial status, demographics
2. `find_inventory_match_tool` - Finds matching properties  
3. `generate_client_message_tool` - Creates human-like SMS

### **Agent Decision Making**
Just like how you think and call tools, the main agent:
1. Gets the client data once
2. Decides to analyze client profile first
3. Then finds inventory matches
4. Finally generates human message
5. Returns simple JSON

## 📋 **Simple JSON Output Format**

```json
{
  "summary": "Brief client profile summary",
  "message": "Human-like SMS message for client", 
  "inventory_found": true/false
}
```

**That's it!** No complex nested objects, no multiple agent responses.

## 💬 **Human-Like Messages**

The message field contains:
- ✅ Natural, conversational tone
- ✅ Under 160 characters (SMS ready)
- ✅ NO placeholder text like `[insert link]`
- ✅ NO AI-sounding language
- ✅ Specific property details
- ✅ Ready to send directly to client

**Example**: `"Hey Dominique! Found a great 2 bed/2 bath in Lombard ($2234-$2318) that fits your needs. Apex 41 on Highland Ave. Let's chat soon!"`

## 🔧 **Usage**

### **Single Function Call**:
```python
from langcahin import process_client

# Just give it a client ID - that's all!
result_json = await process_client(691481)
result = json.loads(result_json)

summary = result['summary']           # Client analysis
message = result['message']           # SMS to send  
found = result['inventory_found']     # True/False
```

### **Streamlit Integration**:
```python
# In your UI, just call this one function
result = await process_client(client_id)
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**

1. **Single Point of Entry**: One function call does everything
2. **No Manual Coordination**: Agent decides which tools to use
3. **Clean Output**: Simple 3-field JSON response
4. **Human Messages**: Ready-to-send SMS text
5. **Boolean Match**: Clear yes/no on inventory found
6. **Automatic Tool Selection**: Like how you decide which tools to call
